# FDF
#ALGORITHM:
this project took me some serious time to do but here i am explaining how i did it .</br>
so the basic of this project is to draw a line on the screen using a C Library named "MiniLibX" u can find its docummentation here:https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html </br>
the algorithm i used an algorithm in which we will take a point "p0(x0, y0)" as a default point with whome we're going to start drawing, </br>
and ofcourse to draw a line we need two points, so now we're looking for a our second point "p1(x1, y1)" </br>
